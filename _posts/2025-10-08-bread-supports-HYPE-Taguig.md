MCGI Bible Readers – Taguig City Chapter attended the launch of HYPE Taguig (Harnessing Youth’s Participation and Energy), the new youth volunteer program of the Taguig Youth Development Office last October 8. 

HYPE gives young Taguigeños the chance to step forward, meet new friends, and grow as leaders while making a difference in the community.

Our group proudly supports this initiative and continues to serve with purpose, passion, and unity!

MATTHEW 5:16 (KJV) 
> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
