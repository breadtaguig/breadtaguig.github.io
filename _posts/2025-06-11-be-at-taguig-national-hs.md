As part of the Nationwide Brigada Eskwela 2025, another school in Taguig became a beneficiary of the ongoing community outreach by the MCGI Bible Readers from Lower Bicutan last June 11.

With a total of 18 dedicated volunteers, the group actively participated in cleaning chairs and walls in a classroom at Taguig National High School, helping prepare a more conducive learning environment for the upcoming school year.

Thanks be to God for the opportunity to do good works!

1 CORINTHIANS 15:58 (KJV)
> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
