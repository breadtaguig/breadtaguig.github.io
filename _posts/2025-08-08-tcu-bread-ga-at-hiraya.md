After successfully reaccrediting the organization in the chapter, the MCGI Bible Readers from Taguig City University recently held a General Assembly with a theme of "Stronger Dough-gether" in order for TCU Breadren to meet, greet, and interact with one another. Fun games, interactions and wisdom from the Bible was shared as the event was held at the Hiraya Youth Convention Center last August 8. 
Hebrews 10:24 (KJV)
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
