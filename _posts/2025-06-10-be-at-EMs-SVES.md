MCGI Bible Readers from Central Signal Village, Taguig City actively participated in EM’s Signal Village Elementary School’s Brigada Eskwela on June 10. 

Volunteers generously contributed their time and effort to repair school materials, clean classrooms, and repaint school facilities, all in preparation for the upcoming school year. 
Thanks be to God for another opportunity to serve our fellowmen.

1 CORINTHIANS 15:58 (KJV) 
> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
