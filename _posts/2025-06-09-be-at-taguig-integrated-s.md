MCGI Bible Readers Taguig Join Brigada Eskwela 2025 Kick-Off at Taguig Integrated School

The MCGI Bible Readers from Taguig City actively participated in the Kick-Off of Taguig City’s Brigada Eskwela 2025 held at Taguig Integrated School last June 9 and 10.

With 59 dedicated volunteers over the course of two days, the group helped paint the first and second floors of one of the school buildings and assisted in cleaning several classrooms, contributing to a more welcoming and inspiring environment for both students and teachers.
It was truly a wonderful opportunity to serve our fellowmen through meaningful action.

Thanks be to God!

1 CORINTHIANS 15:58 (KJV)
> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
