The MCGI Bible Readers, together with the MCGI Youth from Barangay Pinagsama, Taguig City, actively participated in the 2025 Brigada Eskwela at President Diosdado Macapagal National High School last June 9.

Volunteers contributed by repairing furniture and painting school facilities to help prepare for the new academic year. In addition, the group donated cleaning materials and other essential items, and served free lugaw to fellow participants as part of their outreach.

Thanks be to God for another opportunity to do good and serve the community!

1 CORINTHIANS 15:58 (KJV) 
> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
